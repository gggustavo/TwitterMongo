# TwitterMongo

Hello, my name is Gustavo. I want you to do is something very similiar to Twitter.
I want you to create MVC 5 Razor web application with MongoDB database as the backing store.
Use C# driver from MongoDBâ€™s site to add as reference in project.
Use jQuery and Javascript on the client side and for UI, use the Bootstrap framework. 
Messages sorted from latest to oldest.
The posts should contain email address, message content (escape HTML) and how long ago was the message 
posted (in a human friendly fashion, such as, 3 seconds ago.). 
The screen should work asynchronously using Ajax calls. 
Email address should be mailto link. In the top right corner there should be logout button to dismiss the current session.
